# BirthdayBot

Turn the knob to change the song.
Turn the knob all the way to the right to stop playing music and display a happy birthday message.
Leaving the knob alone will play through all the songs automatically.

The LCD displays the song title and how long the song has been playing for. It updates every 3
seconds to avoid lag.

The speaker is set at max volume because it is a cheap speaker and isn't very loud.
